# FAYM Bank

Banking Web app allowing user authentification and money transfers between user accounts.

Developed with PHP's framwork Laravel, Blade, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

Team project where I developed the databases, the backend, the models, users auth and money transfers processing.


## Project requirements

The user should be able to perform the following things:
- Should be able to login into the account.
- Should be able to see all the transactions.
- Should be able to add a contact so that he/she can send money.
- Should have an option to cancel the money within two hours which will work if the receiver
didnâ€™t receive it yet. (Think about having a flag whether the user is received or not)
- Receiver gets the money and it should show the updated amount on their accounts.
- For security purposes, if the user enters the wrong password three times, block their
account for 10 mins.
- Option to update personal information.
